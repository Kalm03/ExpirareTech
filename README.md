You're 2 weeks deep in the semester, the pantry you stocked over the holidays long forgotten and you've been eating DL Chicken for a week now. 

Expirare is a platform where you can find recipes tailored to your pantry!

You can enter all the food you have in your kitchen, with the expiry dates and Expirare will suggest recipes for you to try out!
You can add your own recipes or look at the recipes which use your ingredients from the Edamam API.

Try Expirare for no more food waste!

## Our Vision
According to the National Zero Waste Council's research on household food waste in Canada, almost 2.2 million tonnes of edible food is wasted each year, costing Canadians in excess of [$17 billion](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/recycling-organics-garbage/long-term-waste-strategy/waste-reduction/food-waste/). Most of this food is expired and uneaten at all. 

To combat this problem, our team has developed a web application called Expirare. 
## Expirare's Cool Features

### Recipedia Included:
With the Edamam Recipe API, we have over two million recipes from hundreds of websites, each with a detailed nutrition breakdown. 

Have strict diet restrictions or allergies? No problem! With over 80 diet and health filters, you know exactly what you are eating! If you want a more personal touch, we also have hundreds of shared recipes from users all around the globe for you to peruse. 

Running out of ideas to cook is a thing of the past.

### You know KungFU? Show me!
Have some secret recipe from the ancient times? Know some covert "magic" to help finish up that carrot? Show us! With a single click, you can share your recipe with users all around the globe, helping them reduce their food waste.

### Due today, cook today:
That tomato is expiring in 1 day? No worries, our web-app prioritizes items that is expiring soonest and give suggestions accordingly. Helping you prioritize those who craves that attention.

## How to run:
For now, to test this application, ensure that you have mongoDB installed on your device to implement a database. 

Clone this Github respository and run `npm i` to install the relevant packages.

Once the packages are installed, run `nodemon server.js` or `node server.js` and open port at localhost:8000 to try out our food saver!

## Future Plans:
We believe that Expirare can thrive with new features. In the future, we have suggestions to improve the applications with new features:

1. Providing analytics of food unused through the use of bar charts and graphs to give the users better awareness of their habits
2. Providing nutritional aid by tracking calories
3. Sending push alerts to the users if they wish, through email and sms
4. Add other recipes to your local database
5. Set up user accounts to personalize your selection
6. Use machine learning to learn your favourite recipe and personalise your suggestions
