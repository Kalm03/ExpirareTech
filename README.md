## Future Plans:
We believe that Expirare can thrive with new features. In the future, we have suggestions to improve the applications with new features:

1. Expirare can provide analytics of food unused through the use of bar charts and graphs to give the users better awareness of their habits
2. Expirare can provide nutritional aid by tracking calories
3. Expirare can send push alerts to the users if they wish, through email and sms.
